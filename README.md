```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g jspm
npm install -g generator-scaffi

```bash
yo scaffi

## Developing and Testing
If you make changes to this generator and need to test, run the following while in generator-scaffi:
```bash

This will make it so you can run yo scaffi:* without having to push changes to test


## Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He&#39;s a person with feelings and opinions, but he&#39;s very easy to work with. If you think he&#39;s too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Feel free to [learn more about him](http://yeoman.io/).
